I know this is old news, but it's news nonetheless: [the BBC has a new typeface][1], Reith, named after [John Reith, the founder of the BBC][2]. Their current corporate typeface, Gill Sans, has been put into a long-term retirement plan and will be slowly replaced by its successor due to the size and breadth of the beeb's corporate and digital estate.

On a personal level, I'm fairly fond of Gill Sans as a display face. It looks unmistakeably British in it's proportions; stately and understated, and comes in a raft of beautiful and delicately-cut weights. I would've loved to see what they could do if they introduced one of Gill's other typefaces to the mix, plumping for a serif such as [Pilgrim][3] or [Joanna][4]. But, as is the case with a lot of commercial decisions, it's part economical and part identity: the BBC is a large enough organisation to warrant its own typeface, and this is the perfect opportunity to express themselves with serifs for the first time in digital print. 

David Bailey, Creative Director of the BBC's GEL and UX&D contingent, had this to say about the reasons for commissioning a new typeface:

>  **To improve distinctiveness.** Our previous, most heavily used fonts, Helvetica and Arial, are classic [ grotesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Grotesque) typefaces designed to communicate information anonymously and without fanfare. For the BBC to remain a vital and relevant digital service in an increasingly busy marketplace, we need to appeal to as many people as possible. Having a broader range of expression and visual tonality allows us to stand out in a crowd and aid recognition. A familiar face, so to speak.
>
>  **To improve legibility.** Helvetica, Arial and also Gill Sans (our previous corporate typeface) were designed last century for print. They don’t perform well on today’s digital screens, causing issues with legibility. So this was an opportunity to solve those issues by designing a digitally optimised typeface. 
>
>  **To save money.** By owning our own typeface family, incorporating a range of styles, we can significantly reduce our annual spend on licensing third-party owned fonts. This saving can then be put back into producing world-class content.


It's fairly difficult to argue with any of the above points, let alone the font licensing costs. I'm excited to see which contexts they'll use the serif version, and I truly hope they consider using it for longer thinkpieces and even throughout the whole of the News site, however unlikely that may be.
