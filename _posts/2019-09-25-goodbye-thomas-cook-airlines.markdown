It's been a rather sad week. 

I awoke on Monday morning with my employer simply ceasing to exist. An employer that was extremely profitable, with the most amazing digital team I've had the privilege to work with, makes it all the harder to bear. 

Compulsory liquidation. Two words you really don't want to read at 2.30am on a Monday morning. There's no use lying: It rankled and stung very deeply that I'd been led to believe the company would been safe; and at the very least the profitable arms of the business might have been spared. 

I wish all my colleagues all the best.
