I've been thinking a lot lately about complexity, and how we, as designers, can better define the complexity/simplicity sweet-spot. This was largely sparked by [this inspiring graphic essay on complexity](https://extranewsfeed.com/making-sense-of-complexity-ee78755d56b9) and a provoking lament from Isaac Newton:

> 'I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.'

The frustration in that statement cuts deep. Even today, we can [land a probe the size of a washing machine on a comet travelling at 84,000mph](), but the vast majority of us (maybe all of us) still don't understand the nuances and intricacies of behaviour and social change. Starting last year, I work as part of an integrated product team, iterating and exploring different options within some clear(ish) boundaries. What I soon discovered, to my horror, was the reality that even with a water-tight hypothesis the results were increasingly difficult to explain due to there being far too many variables, and far too much complexity. In most cases, the results were inconclusive, leading me to believe that the World Wide Web, and humans' interactions with it, appears to be one of those *unknowns unknows* that only so much data-hoarding and rigorous interrogation can attempt to explain, for a very interesting and simple reason: [human behaviour is *intrinsically unpredictable* (Â£)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1174887?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). 

Human unpredictability aside, there are still many technological twists, turns and tangles lurking out there ready to trap an intrepid designer enveloped in the digital world. Many of them are a symptom of problem solving the short way - plugging a leak with more technology. The amount of convoluted workarounds I've been privy to are beyond mind-boggling, and that's not for lack of trying to keep work and functionality as simple as possible. MVPs are launched with the best intentions, but many are still more or less VPs, due to the cumulative effect of dithering, politics, and a disregard (or over-regard) for mitigating risk by key stakeholders. Designers are frequently employed as problem-solvers, using divergence and convergence methods and a light-touch approach to explore different ways to attack a particular issue. So, framing the question as a problem...

...we start to see the enormity of the issue at hand. I remember a colleague of mine, an engineer, said this of current web technology:

> 'We can solve almost any problem, and do almost anything. It's just a question of how much time you want to waste doing it.'

This approach helps me sense check what I'm doing most of the time. Sure, we can do it. But, do we want to? And is it worth it?

In my case, I recently applied this question to my own home on the web. What is this little chunk of web meant to do, and represent? I could waste several months creating a dusty, room-filled mansion that is beyond my scope to maintain. But in the end I chose a comfortable, well-equipped apartment. You'll notice there are no case studies, no portfolio and no 'homepage'. I'll add more functionality, posts and work as and when I need it, rather than creating a country pile with no inhabitants - just the way I like it.
