<p class="lead">I'm a multidisciplinary designer with a love of creative arts, typography, and the world wide web, hailing from the lovely northern town of Lancaster. I now live and work in the substantially less town-like, but just as lovely (and northern) metropolis of Manchester.</p>

I'm UX Designer at [Booking.com](https://booking.com), where I'm working on rethinking the central tenets of what we would call a 'trip'. Plenty of exciting things to share, so watch this space! 

Previously, I improved customers' car financing experience with the fine folks of [Zuto](https://www.zuto.com). Prior to that, I helped improve hundreds of client's brands and customer-facing design both online and in print for the smashing chaps at [Fat Media](https://www.fatmedia.co.uk).
