<p class="lead">I'm a multidisciplinary designer with a love of creative arts, typography, and the world wide web, hailing from the lovely northern town of Lancaster. I now live and work in the substantially less town-like, but just as lovely (and northern) metropolis of Manchester.</p>

I've recently joined [Thomas Cook Airlines][0] as a UX Designer, where I'll be responsible for a whole host of exiting things. 

Previously, I improved customers' car financing experience with the fine folks of [Zuto][1]. Prior to that, I helped improve hundreds of client's brands and customer-facing design both online and in print for the smashing chaps at [Fat Media][2].
