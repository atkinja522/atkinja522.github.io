So, last I checked, I've left this website fallow for a little over a year&emdash;so yes, maybe an update is in order. Not that I said [anything about updating my blog more often, oh no][1].  

Well, I don't know where to start. 2019 was just *so unbelievably busy*! To gloss over the ups and downs and summarise: New job, bathroom ripped out, Holiday (well, stag party), my Wedding day 💍, honeymoon, lost said new job, got another job, holiday, Christmas. In that order.

The biggest upset of this year - understandably, I hope - was losing my new, dream job. For those in the UK reading this, I need only mention  two words: Thomas Cook. I joined Thomas Cook Airlines as User Experience Designer in March of 2019, and joined a freshly-minted digital team that had fantastic ideas, a great work ethic, and more important than all of those things - a perfect, near-flawless cultural fit. Now, I'm not going to go into too much detail as I feel I've got a larger post to write on the topic, but, if you've ever had the post-honeymoon blues, having to sign on two weeks after you land back home certainly forced a different perspective. 

Another thing to add into this mix: I've slowly become rather dissatisfied with this site. It's *nice*, but not exactly representative of me, my style, or even what I like. Eagle eyed readers might notice a new little illustration I made of myself looking awkwardly to the left on my new homepage; the first such illustration effort in a very, very long time. This is the first step towards achieving those overdue #goals from last year - and at least there's been a little effort involved.
