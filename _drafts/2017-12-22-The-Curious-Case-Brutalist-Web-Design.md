Brutalism is a term mostly applied to such architectural ~~horrors~~ marvels like [Preston Bus Station][1], the [Trellick Tower][2], and the [Royal National Theatre][3]. But, no longer! In a strange turn of fate, designers the world over are shunning usability and commonplace aesthetics, and really going to town with concept of Brutalism, only translated to 2D, for your viewing pleasure.

So... what is the concept of Brutalism? In architectural terms, it's pretty simple: big, mean, crude, form-follows-function style buildings with a unapologetic display of their inner gubbins, and which care *not a jot* for your stylistic sensibilities. Translate that raw realness to a screen, and you have the antithesis to generally accepted principles: bright, garish colours that wouldn't have a hope in hell of passing the colour contrast ratios, oversized text and overlapping images. And probably some Times New Roman thrown in for a bit of irony.

All that is well and good - if you want to design a site like that, go ahead! What's more interesting to me is the *why*. Why now? The most plausible answer to this question is the same as many in the world of design: rebellion. At it's root, I can see a resistance to what has been a monotonous time for creatives on the web. Perhaps it was about time that things worked out for the creative, tech savvy user rather than the rather stupid users we normally have to deal with.
