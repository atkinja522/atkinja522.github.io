It's been a rather sad week. 

I awoke on Monday morning with my employer simply ceasing to exist. 

Compulsory liquidation. Two words you really don't want to read at 2.30am on a Monday morning. There's no use lying: It rankled and stung very deeply that I'd been led to believe the company would been safe; and at the very least the profitable arms of the business might have been spared.

It also hurt deeply that all my talented colleagues now had no job left, some being with the company over 20 years. 

I wish all my colleagues the very best of luck.
