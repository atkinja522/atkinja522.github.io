For the uninitiated, shipping is the 'continuous delivery' part of continuous delivery. It's also a cornerstone of the agile methodology. *But* - and that is a big *but* - classically trained designers and art directors will certainly develop a bee in the bonnet. A bee that represents their worst nightmares - sacrificing visual and developmental quality for quantity and cadence.

But what am I on about?

To fully understand both sides of the equation - designers, and their engineer compatriots - we need to delve into the respective working processes. 

## The Engineer's Workflow

The engineer's workflow looks a little something like this (through the lens of someone who has never done software engineering) - 

1. Discuss which engineer works on which work ticket during the daily standup
2. Work on the ticket. Test the code. Do things.
3. Stick it in QA. Unit test it. E2E test it. Make sure it doesn't break.
4. Nothing broken? The thing works?
5. Peer review with stakeholders (normally this part is fictioin)
6. SHIP IT.
7. Continue from Step 1. 

Quite a methodical workflow, as I'm sure you'd agree.
